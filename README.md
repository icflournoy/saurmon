Saurmon
=====

**Please be aware this is very hacked together at the moment. Who knows, maybe in a week it'll be rewritten as a beautiful perl program**

That being said Saurmon is a collection of scripts (right now, two) to reach out to a list of hosts and gather back system hardware data.

It was written initally to aggregate S.M.A.R.T values from all the disks in a Hadoop cluster since disks were failing and I wanted to know why.
